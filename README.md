# vue-test-utils-bug

This projects demonstrate failing tests if vue-i18n is used together with an composable. For reproduction have a look in the commit history.

- first commit shows failing tests
- second and third commits fixes the problem either by removing the composable or removing vue-i18n from app configuration

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Run tests

```sh
npm run test
```
